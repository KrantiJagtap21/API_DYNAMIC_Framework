# API_DYNAMIC_Framework
This project is capable to automate execution and validation : POST ,PUT, PATCH and GET
User can also construct the request body using parameters fed from excelFile, I have created an utility using ApachePoi to read data from excel
This project is built on the concept of data driven and keyword driven.
      I have devided the project into four packages as request repository, test class, common methods and driver class.
the test execution is driven by Dynamic XML
The project is capable of saving the evidence of execution into text files which contains details of request sent, endpoint and response received.
